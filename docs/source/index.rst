These pages provide documentation of the ``cosmicsense`` package which is
being developed as part of the CosmicSense Research Group funded by the German
Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG).

The ``cosmicsense`` package provides a platform to collect algorithms and
workflows to estimate soil moisture from cosmic ray neutron counters, and
compare such estimates with other soil moisture products.
